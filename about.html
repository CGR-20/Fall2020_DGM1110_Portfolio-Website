                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>I'm currently a student at Utah Valley University, majoring in Computer Science and minoring
                in Digital Media. I know how to program in a couple of programming languages, including HTML - which
                is how I was able to code this very website. I feel like writing and creating software and programs is 
                what I should do for a living, but I also recently got into media design, since I'm interested in learning 
                new things and figured that it could be fun.</p>
                <p>In terms of who I am as a person, I'm nothing all that special. I'm a young man living with my (birth) family, who's
                not currently interested in getting into a romantic relationship anytime soon (especially with what's happening right now).
                I like to spend free time playing video games and watching silly videos online.</p>
                <p>All in all, I'm a pretty average guy. One who knows how to code their own website, sure, but average.</p>
